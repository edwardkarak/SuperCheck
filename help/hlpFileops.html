		<p>
			When you first open SuperCheck, the first thing one will see is a new, blank file initially called "Untitled". 
			This is analogous to opening Microsoft Word, and seeing a new document called "Document1". You can immediately 
			get to work.
		</p>
		<h2>Save As</h2>
		<p>
			When you are done working with "Untitled", and choose to Save it, a box will appear, asking for a new name for the
			file. For example, if this is a savings account file, a good name would be "savings". When you are done press "OK". The next time you
			open SuperCheck, you will see a dialog box appear, with a list of different SuperCheck files. Select one, and then
			press "Open". The file will be opened and the main window will show the file's contents.
		</p>
		
		<h2 id="jmpSave">Save</h2>
		<p>
			When you need to save changes, and the file is not "Untitled", then when you press Save, no box will appear. This is
			because you have already chosen a name for the file, and it already exists. The only thing that will happen is the
			status bar's first section will say "Saved", and the changes will be saved.
		</p>
		<p>
			SuperCheck also has an autosave feature, which will save changes to the file every five minutes, by default. You can change
			this interval in File->Settings->Preferences tab. Autosave will not save if the file
			is Untitled, since the file does not even exist at that point.
		</p>
		
		<h2 id="jmpNew">New</h2>
		<p>
			To create a new file, press the New button in the toolbar (white paper icon), go to File->New, or press the keyboard hotkey 
			CTRL + N. If the current file has changes that need to be saved, SuperCheck will ask if you want to save these changes 
			before creating the new, blank file. The new file's name is Untitled. If the current file is Untitled, the "New" button
			will be grayed out. To enable the "New" button, you need to save the Untitled file first.
		</p>
		
		<h2 id ="jmpOpen">Open</h2>
		<p>
			To open a file, press the Open button in the toolbar (manilla folder icon), go to File->Open, or press CTRL + O.
			If the current file has changes that need to be saved, SuperCheck will ask if you want to save these changes.
		</p>
		<p>
			Then, an "Open" dialog will appear, which contains a list of files you may open. Click on the file, and press "Open".
			The file currently open will close, to allow the file you selected to open. You may not open a file that is open
			elsewhere. To cancel opening, press the "X" button in the upper right corner. 
		</p>
		
		<h2 id="jmpRenam">Renaming</h2>
		<p>
			You can rename a file, even when it is open in SuperCheck. To rename a file:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Press F2</li>
			<li>Select "Rename this account" from the "File" menu</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			When you do one of the above, a window will appear, asking for the new name. Do so, press OK, and the file will be renamed.
			No data will be lost and the title bar text will change.
		</p>
		<p>
			Note that you may not rename when the file is untitled. In fact, "Rename" in the "File" menu will be disabled. This is because
			the file does not even exist on the hard drive yet.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Removing</h2>
		<p>
			You can remove a file, even when it is open in SuperCheck. To remove a file, select "Remove this account" from the "File" menu.
		</p>
		
		<h2 id="jmpExportExcel">Export to Excel</h2>
		<p>
			You can export a SuperCheck account into Excel (xls). To do this, select "Export to Excel" from the "File" menu. A message box
			will appear. Press "OK" to open the Excel file now. Press Cancel to not open the Excel file now.
